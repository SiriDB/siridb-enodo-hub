# Enodo Hub



The enode hub communicates and guides both the listener as the worker. The hub tells the listener to which series it needs to pay attention to, and it tells the worker which series should be analysed.
Clients can connect to the hub for receiving updates, and polling for data. Also a client can use the hub to alter the data about which series should be watched.
